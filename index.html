      <h1>Get to know me, Alejandra Lopez!</h1>
      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>I was born Puerto Rico, I grew up by the ocean water, building sand castles and truly being what they call an island baby. At nine years old my family moved to the Dominican Republic, where, for the first time, I had to learn how to adapt to a new environment. I spent 4 wonderful years there and discovered my passion for acting, theater, and dancing. We then moved to Miami, where I was able to further develop my artistic skills and jump into the world of entertainment. 
      <h3>Academic Background</h3>
      <p>I began my academic journey at the University of Florida, where I got my Bachelor's Degree for Public Relations. During that time I also explored my artistic passions by going to professional makeup school and getting my masters for Special Effects makeup. Learning about PR principles and making aliens at the same time was a busy but rewarding and exciting experience. Although I had a busy schedule, my love for learning didn't stop. I began my combination degree program, beginning my Master's Degree for Digital Strategies. I'm currently on my second-to-last semester for my Master's.
